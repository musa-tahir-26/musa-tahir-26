## About Me:
Ever since my dad got me my first gaming console, the Game Boy Advance SP, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by how technology works. That curiosity led me to also tinker with our home computer, where I learned to delete unnecessary files and download games. It made me think about how we can build things that make life easier (or, in this case, more fun too). I am now studying computer science at UIC, where Iâ€™m a sophomore. Currently, I am learning C as a part of my coursework to get a deeper understanding of low-level programming concepts.

Right now, Iâ€™m sharpening my web and mobile development skills and working on projects that push my understanding of full-stack development. My past projects include a presidential election data explorer and a 1024 game, both built in C++ as part of my coursework. As I transition into web technologies, Iâ€™m excited to create interactive web apps and browser extensions.

My goal is to land an internship where I can apply my skills, grow as a developer, and collaborate on impactful projects. If youâ€™re looking for someone eager to learn and build, letâ€™s connect! You can reach me on [https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-musa-tahir/](LinkedIn)
